#The project is a 4th year project of RICM option in Polytech Grenoble by Simon Chambonnet and Boris Odi√®vre.
The objectif of our part of project is to show at a lambda folk, a representation of flight instruments.
We use Meteor with Apache Cordova to show on any type support, but we will use mainly android tablet.
to get back the informations and ensure to send at any people simply we will do that with Mosquitto (MQQT protocol).
And in second time it will be interesting to observe this DB (trafic, number of people, ...) by Grafana.
#Currently the project is in progress.
